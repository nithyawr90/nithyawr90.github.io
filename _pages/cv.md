Work Experience
----------------
* **Texas Instruments** - System Validation Engineer _(Oct'19 - Present)_      
  * Responsible for system level testing of USB type C power  delivery controllers 
  * Compatibility testing of DUT with customer products 
  * Test plan and automation framework development 
* **Intel Corporation** - System Validation Engineer _(April'19 - Sep'19)_    
Validation activities at Intel Corporation:     
  * Responsible for the validation of the Peer to Peer communication between TBT devices  
  * DMA performance validation and compliance with USB 4.0  
  * Set up a version control system for the team from scratch
* **Microchip Technology Inc.** - Pre and Post Si Validation Engineer _(Jun'14 - Mar'19)_     
Pre and Post Silicon Validation of Digital IPs of the PIC32 and SAM  Microcontrollers:     
  * Worked on development of test suites and validation of multiple digital IPs such as CAN, SPI, GPU and validation of the System bus- which involves interaction of multiple IPs, on  both silicon samples as well as FPGA emulation platforms. 
  * Complete ownership of the CAN-FD module validation {plan,  testing and report}. This test suite was later adopted across several divisions across the company for its robustness and coverage, especially the error injection testing. 
  * Characterization of multiple IPs by testing them across process, voltage and temperature. 
  * Have developed validation plans, functionally tested and presented detailed validation reports of multiple modules GPU, CAN, CANFD, SSX 
  * Have worked on layouts for multiple speed boards using Altium designer  

Technical Skills
------------------
* **Functional Validation**- experience in developing functional test suites for several digital IPs
	* Development of Plan/ Report: Complete coverage analysis and test plan development from scratch. 
	* DUT code development: written the functional DUT test code using embedded C for several digital modules 
* **Automation**: complete automation testing using Teststand and have experience in automation using Python 
* **Software Tools**: Experienced in the use of embedded C, Python, Teststand (basics), Altium (for board design),IAR( for ARM based products), MPlabX(for MIPS based products), Git and SVN version control systems, CAPL coding(for Vector tools), debugging using Trace32, Atlassian tools (Confluence, JIRA),Version control systems like- Git and SVN
* **Hardware**- some experience with high speed board design, experience with hardware debugging, worked with oscilloscopes, power supply, DMM etc.
	* Worked with the VN1630A and the VH6501 CAN analyzer and error injector and debugging with Lauterbach{JTAG tool
	* Protocol specific tools: have worked with protocol specific tools for the CAN and CAN-FD. 
* Understanding of microcontroller architecture and interaction of IPs
* **Pre-silicon validation**- bring up and testing of several IPs on the FPGA platform. This helped reduce bring up time on actual silicon considerably.
* Other skills include, working on different levels of testingunit/integrated, understanding of the validation framework, PVT (Process, Voltage and Temperature) testing and electrical testing. 
* **Understanding of type C subsystems**- Thunderbolt and USB-C PD

Soft Skills
-----------------------
* Have worked with cross site teams located in Chandler, Arizona {USA}, Nantes and Rousset {France} 
* Work well with other teams for successful collaboration and debug (design, verification and applications)
* Have a good deal of experience presenting validation plans and reports to the product development teams 
* Have assisted in recreating and debugging of customer issues
* Have mentored newer people in the team helping them understand processes and assisted with debug. 
* Exemplary communication skills â€“ fluent in English, Hindi and Tamil
