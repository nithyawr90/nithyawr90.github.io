Work Experience
----------------
* **Texas Instruments** - System Validation Engineer _(Oct'19 - Present)_
  * Responsible for system level testing of USB type C power  delivery controllers 
  * Compatibility testing of DUT with customer products 
  * Test plan and automation framework development 
* **Intel Corporation** - System Validation Engineer _(April'19 - Sep'19)_
Validation activities at Intel Corporation:  
  * Responsible for the validation of the Peer to Peer communication between TBT devices  
  * DMA performance validation and compliance with USB 4.0  
  * Set up a version control system for the team from scratch
* **Microchip Technology Inc.** - Pre and Post Si Validation Engineer _(Jun'14 - Mar'19)_
Pre and Post Silicon Validation of Digital IPs of the PIC32 and SAM  Microcontrollers:  
  * Worked on development of test suites and validation of multiple digital IPs such as CAN, SPI, GPU and validation of the System bus- which involves interaction of multiple IPs, on  both silicon samples as well as FPGA emulation platforms. 
  * Complete ownership of the CAN-FD module validation {plan,  testing and report}. This test suite was later adopted across several divisions across the company for its robustness and coverage, especially the error injection testing. 
  * Characterization of multiple IPs by testing them across process, voltage and temperature. 
  * Have developed validation plans, functionally tested and presented detailed validation reports of multiple modules GPU, CAN, CANFD, SSX 
  * Have worked on layouts for multiple speed boards using Altium designer  

Research Experience
